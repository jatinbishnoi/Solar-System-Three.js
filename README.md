# üöÄ 3D Solar System Simulation - Three.js

This is a real-time, interactive 3D simulation of our Solar System, meticulously crafted using **Three.js**. It brings the cosmos to your browser, visualizing the Sun and all 8 planets with their dynamic orbital paths, accurate inclinations, and smooth animations. Engage with the planets through intuitive UI features, including speed control, informative tooltips, and an immersive click-to-zoom functionality.
